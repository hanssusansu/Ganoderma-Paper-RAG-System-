Different\nextractions from G. lucidum have been used to manage age-related diseases,\nincluding cancer. Nevertheless, the senolytic activity of G. lucidum against\nsenescent\ncancer\ncells\nhas\nnot\nbeen\ninvestigated. Although\ncellular\nsenescence causes tumor growth inhibition, senescent cells promote the\ngrowth of the neighboring tumor cells through paracrine effects. Therefore,\nthe elimination of senescent cells is a new strategy for cancer treatment.",

It is a chronic inflammatory disease that\naffects the mucosa under removable dentures,\nparticularly complete maxillary dentures, with\na\nprevalence\nrate\nof\n11%-67%. This\ninflammatory condition can cause symptoms\nsuch as erythema, swelling of the mucous\nmembranes, and occasional pain and burning\nsensation [1-3]. DS is a multifactorial disease,\nand poor denture hygiene and its suboptimal\nadaptation,\ndiabetes\nmellitus,\nsmoking,\nallergies,\nnutrition,\nand\nmultiple\nmicroorganisms have been suggested as its\ncommon\netiologies.

However, only a few have been isolated\nfrom humans, and C. albicans remains the\nmost common cause of fungal disease in\nhumans due to its high pathogenicity [5]. One of the most commonly used classifications of\nDS was presented by Av [6] and Ostlund [7],\nwhich includes three types: Type I is DS with\nhyperemic foci, type II is DS with diffuse\nhyperemia, and type III is DS with granular\ninflammation. DS is generally followed by\nerythema, swelling of the oral mucosa, and\noccasional pain or burning sensation [8]. Elimination of predisposing factors is the first\nstrategy in treatment of oral candidiasis, and\nvarious topical and systemic agents are\ncurrently available for this purpose [9]. Topical agents such as nystatin, amphotericin\nB,\nmiconazole,\nand\nclotrimazole\nare\nrecommended as the first-line treatment [9].",

The association of age, sex, history of denture\nuse, denture cleaning, sleeping with denture,\nsmoking, and Av [6] and Ostlund [7]\nclassification with the recovery of DS was also\ninvestigated. The results indicated that only\nthe Av [6] and Ostlund [7] classification and\nsleeping with denture had a significant\nassociation with DS recovery. In other words, the percentage of complete\nrecovery was significantly higher in patients\nwith DS type I and patients that removed their\ndenture overnight (before entering the study). In fact, it can be stated that removing denture\novernight can be effective for relaxing the jaw\nand mouth and prevent the occurrence of DS\nor decrease its intensity as much as possible.

It is the leading cancer site and cause of cancer death in the U.S. Hispanic female population\n(1). Moreover, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal and least understood\nform of advanced breast cancer, and this lethality originates from its highly invasive nature\nand absence of a palpable tumor mass. Current IBC therapy is composed of systemic therapy\n(primary anthracycline-based chemotherapy), with radiotherapy and surgery (2). Anthracy-\nclines cause destructive cellular effects affecting both cancer and noncancerous cells—thus\ntargeted methods are needed to combat this intractable disease. Reishi, a basidiomycetous fungus, is an edible medicinal mushroom used in complementary\nand alternative medicine, particularly in Asian countries for the past 2 millennia (3).

Therefore, contrary to other types of\naggressive breast cancers, it is beneficial to treat IBC with agents that disrupt tumor\nspheroids and reduce E-cadherin expression to inhibit progression (14). Although inhibitory effects of Reishi have been shown in multiple cancers, some of the\nanticancer effects may be a result of stimulation of the immune system by polysaccharides,\ncytotoxic effects of triterpenes, and/or dysregulation of intracellular signaling (15).

    "content": "This action can be\ncorrelated with reduced viability and inhibition of eIF4G, E-cadherin, MMP-9, and p120-\ncatenin, key proteins responsible for tumor growth and invasion in IBC. The selection of\nReishi extract was due to current use by local naturopathic physicians in cancer patients\nwhere it has been shown to improve the quality and prolong patient’s lives, and not interfere\nwith chemotherapy. However, to date, effects of Reishi extract have not been tested on IBC\ncells or patients. Studies are being conducted in vivo to test the efficacy of Reishi in IBC\nusing a SCID mouse model. Therefore, our findings suggest that Reishi extract could be\nused as a novel anticancer therapeutic for IBC patients.

Because of advances in diagnosis and medical treatment\nof breast cancer, the number of survivors has grown rapidly. These survivors have some conditions and symptoms that\ncan aﬀect not only the quality of their lives, but also their\noverall survival time [2–4]. One of symptoms which the\nbreast cancer patients often reported is fatigue [5]. Cancer-\nrelated fatigue (CRF) is a distressing, persistent, and sub-\njective sense of physical, emotional, and cognitive tiredness\nrelated to cancer or cancer treatment that is not proportional\nto recent activity and interferes with normal functioning [6].",

Other poten-\ntial factors to consider are some physical distress, such as ane-\nmia, coronary artery disease, metabolic abnormalities, and\nemotional distress including anxiety and depression [10, 11]. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of fatigue in breast\ncancer patients are not completely understood. Barsevick\net al. ﬁnd that there are many potential mechanisms\nwhich can result in CRF. These mechanisms include that\ncytokine disorder, 5-hydroxy tryptophan (5-HT) neurotrans-\nmitter dysregulation, abnormal hypothalamic-pituitarya-\ndrenal (HPA) axis function, and unusual metabolism of ade-\nnosine tri-phosphate (ATP) and muscle.",

Discussion\nThis pilot study suggests that spore powder of G. lucidum\nmay have beneﬁcial eﬀects on cancer-related fatigue and\nquality of life in breast cancer patients undergoing endocrine\ntherapy without any signiﬁcant adverse eﬀect. The patients\nwho received with spore powder of G. lucidum for 4 weeks\ncan decrease degree of fatigue. To our knowledge, this is the\nﬁrst detailed study of adherence to an individualized tradi-\ntional Chinese medicine intervention targeting generalized\ncancer-related fatigue during endocrine therapy. Endocrine therapy was proposed as a treatment for breast\ncancer in patients who were with estrogen and/or pro-\ngesterone receptor-positive tumors. Studies indicate that the\nfatigue prevalence in patients with breast cancer is high dur-\ning the endocrine treatment [34].",

Despite exercise or psycholog-\nical treatments and some medicines used to improve the\ncancer-related fatigue, these methods may have some short-\ncomings and deﬁciencies. In this pilot clinical trial, we apply traditional Chinese\nmedicine spore powder of G. lucidum to improve cancer-\nrelated fatigue.

Spore of G. lucidum may oﬀer a useful com-\nplementary treatment that can improve the situations in the\nexperimental group. This pilot clinical trial is the ﬁrst step to\nexplore the eﬃcacy of herbal therapy on fatigue and quality\nof life in breast cancer patients. Results from the studies could\nprovide evidence for eﬃcacy and might be used to design\nmore future comprehensive studies.

Various active compounds have been tested against various\ncomponents of the virus in the effort to halt the virus development in infected host. The idea of finding cure from known\npharmacologically active natural occurring compounds is intriguing and practical. Ganoderma lucidum (Ling-Zhi or Reishi) is one\nof the most productive and pharmacologically active compounds found in Asian countries. It has been used traditionally for many\nyears throughout different cultures. More than a decade ago, el-Mekkawy and co-workers (1998) have tested several active\ncompounds found in this plant. They have successfully identified several active compounds with reasonable inhibitory activity\nagainst HIV protease however; no further studies were done on these compounds.",

Introduction\nThe fruiting body of Ganoderma lucidum known as Ling\nZhi in China, one of the most famous traditional Chi-\nnese medicinal mushroom, has been used extensively for\nlongevity and health promotion in China and other Asian\ncountries for thousands of years [1–3]. Although it is still\nnot clear about Ling Zhi’s mechanism on longevity and\nhealth promotion, Ling Zhi has been used for the prevention\nor treatment of various conditions and diseases such as\nanorexia, neurasthenia, insomnia, migraine, allergy, asthma,\nbronchitis, gastritis, hepatitis, nephritis, arthritis, lupus ery-\nthematosus, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,\ncardiovascular problems, and cancers [2, 3]. Modern investigations have revealed that Ling Zhi con-\ntains a variety of phytochemical compounds.

Introduction\nLung carcinoma is the most predominant form of cancer and\nhas surpassed breast carcinoma as the leading cause of cancer\nmortality in the United States; it accounts for approximately\n26% and 28% of all female and male cancer deaths, respec-\ntively [1]. Lung carcinoma was also the leading cause of can-\ncer death in Taiwan for women and men in 2010 [2]. More-\nover, an apparent increasing death rate of lung carcinoma\nfrom 1986 to 2010 has also been observed in Taiwan [2]. The two most aggressive forms of lung cancer are non-small-\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC),\nwhich account for approximately 85% and 15%, respectively,\nof all lung cancers [3]. Both forms of lung cancer frequently\ncause drug resistance leading to poor survival [4].

Discussion\nA number of Chinese herbal medicines have demonstrated\nsigniﬁcant potential as anticancer therapeutic agents due to\ntheir growth suppression eﬀects on tumor cells [25, 26]. Among these medicines, Ganoderma is the most widely used\nherbal medicine in Asia and has been used for centuries. Ganoderma tsugae (GT), one of the most major species\ncultivated in Taiwan, has been shown to exhibit anti-\nproliferative eﬀects against human tumor cells [12, 13]. In\nthis study, we investigated the anticancer eﬀects of the GT on\nthe NSCLC H23/0.3 cells in vitro (Figure 2(a)) and in vivo\n(Figure 7(a)). Botanical products, especially TCMs, are mixtures of\nphytochemicals that are not deﬁned by the standard formula\nas pure chemical compounds, thus presenting a diﬃcult\nissue for the scientiﬁc requirements of quality control (QC). Chemical ﬁngerprinting is usually viewed as a gold standard\nto identify TCMs [27]; however, this method may not be the\nbest method to achieve this core purpose.",

IBC is a lethal and aggressive form of breast cancer that manifests itself without a\ntypical tumor mass. Studies show that IBC tissue biopsies overexpress E-cadherin and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4GI\n(eIF4GI), two proteins that are partially responsible for the unique pathological properties of this disease. IBC is treated with\na multimodal approach that includes non-targeted systemic chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Because of its non-toxic\nand selective anti-cancer activity, medicinal mushroom extracts have received attention for their use in cancer therapy. Our\nprevious studies demonstrate these selective anti-cancer effects of Reishi, where IBC cell viability and invasion, as well as the\nexpression of key IBC molecules, including eIF4G is compromised.",

The present study demonstrates that Reishi treated IBC SUM-149 cells have reduced expression of\nmTOR downstream effectors at early treatment times, as we observe reduced eIF4G levels coupled with increased levels of\neIF4E bound to 4E-BP, with consequential protein synthesis reduction. Severe combined immunodeficient mice injected\nwith IBC cells treated with Reishi for 13 weeks show reduced tumor growth and weight by ,50%, and Reishi treated tumors\nshowed reduced expression of E-cadherin, mTOR, eIF4G, and p70S6K, and activity of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK1/2).",

In IBC, cancer cells\nblock dermal lymphatics of the breast causing an inflammatory\nphenotype. IBC lethality derives from generation of tumor\nemboli, which are non-adherent cell clusters that rapidly spread\ninto the dermal lymphatics by a form of continuous invasion\nknown as passive metastasis. Despite improvements in survival\nand outcomes for breast cancer generally over the last 20 years,\npatients with IBC continue to have a poorer prognosis with 5-\nyear survival rates of 50% [1], whereas the average comparable\nrates for patients with non-inflammatory breast cancers are 70%\nto 80%. Standard IBC treatment involves non-targeted chemo-\ntherapy or a combination of several agents including radiation\ntherapy, hormonal therapy and surgery.",

Moreover, studies show that the same Reishi\nextract as the one used in the current study inhibits AP-1 and NF-\nkB transcriptional activation in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells\n[7,28]. Contrary to Jiang et al. results, where they show that\nReishi inhibits Akt expression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells\n[28] our study shows that in IBC cells, the same Reishi extract\nreduces AKT1 gene levels, but not Akt protein expression or\nphosphorylation.

This phenomenon\nwas reported in a similar study where caliper measurements could\nnot be initiated until 30 days following SUM-149 cell inoculation\nat the mammary fat pad of SCID mice [31].

Introduction\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a 185-\nkDa transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), belong-\ning to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family,\nwhich contains four homologous members: EGFR/HER1,\nHER2, HER3, and HER4. Ligand stimulation induces dimer-\nization of the HER receptor (homo- or heterodimer), which\nleads to self-phosphorylation (except for HER3) on tyrosine\nresidues localized to the C-terminal domain of HER recep-\ntors. Then, the phosphorylated HER receptors (activated\nform) activate a variety of downstream signaling pathways,\nsuch as the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and\nthe Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways,\nwhich in turn promote cell proliferation, survival, and metas-\ntasis [1].\n2\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nAberrant upregulation of HER2 is found in approximately\n25–30% of breast cancers [2] and in 6–50% of ovarian cancers\n[3].",

Therefore,\ninhibition of HER2 expression or its kinase activity may be an\neffective approach for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing\ncancers. In fact, a number of HER2-targeting agents, includ-\ning monoclonal antibodies (e.g., trastuzumab) and small-\nmolecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., lapatinib), have\nbeen developed for the treatment of cancers with HER2-\noverexpression [1]. However, there is still a need for novel\ntherapies to treat HER2-overexpressing cancers. For example,\ntraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and botanical products\nare currently considered to be safer and may be used as\nalternative therapeutic agents for treatment of cancers that\noverexpress HER2 [5, 6].

Treatment with therapeutic agents that specifically target\ncancer cells with HER2-overexpression, such as lapatinib and\ntrastuzumab, has improved clinical outcomes. In addition\nto the anticancer agents, a number of TCMs and botanical\nproducts have been shown to be effective and useful adjuvant\nagents for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing cancer [5,\n6, 26]. Ganoderma tsugae (GT), one of the most common\nspecies of Ganoderma cultivated in Taiwan, has been shown\nto have antiproliferative effects on human cancer cells [15, 16,\n18]. In this study, we report for the first time that the extract of\nGT (GTE) has a distinct growth-inhibitory effect on HER2-\noverexpressing cancer cells in vitro (Figures 1(a)–1(c)) and in\nvivo (Figure 5(a)). Perturbation of cell cycle progression in cancer cells is\na useful strategy to arrest cancer growth [28].",

Introduction\nIt is well documented that regular physical exercise has many\nbeneﬁcial effects, and is an effective means for preventing\nchronic diseases (Goto et al., 2004; Warburton et al., 2006;\nArau´ jo et al., 2011). However, strenuous physical exercise is\nassociated with a dramatic increase in oxygen uptake both\nby the whole body and particularly by the skeletal muscle\n(Bejma and Ji, 1999). Oxygen usage increases with increasing\nmetabolic activity and the results in reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) production (Powers and Jackson, 2008). Production\nof ROS in quantities that overwhelm the endogenous antioxi-\ndant defense system has been referred to as oxidative stress,\nwhich can lead to the destruction of tissue and cell macromol-\necules such as lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids (Jo´ wko et al.,\n2011).

The antioxidant defense systems of the living body con-\nsist of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant nutrients, which\nmay be involved in reducing oxidative stress (Lee et al., 2009). Principal antioxidant enzymes include SOD, GPX and CAT. SOD catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and\nhydrogen peroxide. GPX is a selenoenzyme which catalyzes\nthe reduction of hydroperoxides at the expense of reduced glu-\ntathione. CAT is a primary antioxidant defense component that\nworks to catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to\nwater, sharing this function with GPX (Apel and Hirt, 2004).",

DM is a common, morbid\nand costly disease, affecting more than 1 in 10 adults in\nboth United States and China [1]. DM is the leading\ncause of new blindness, amputation and end-stage renal\ndiseases and it also contributes to a host of other condi-\ntions. Although there is no published data for the\nmedical cost of diabetes in China in recent years, the\nmedical costs of managing DM and its complications\nexceeded $115 billion in the United States alone in 2011\nand the indirect costs added another $58 billion [1]. Evi-\ndence suggests that DM complications can be markedly\nattenuated with appropriate control of blood pressure\nand hyperglycemia and with successful treatment of\nhyperlipidemia. Thus, there is a great interest in novel\napproaches\nto\nindirect DM management.",

The spores contain many bioactive substances, in-\ncluding lanostane type triterpenes [11] and polysaccha-\nrides [12] similar to those in the fruiting body [13]. Other characteristics of the bioactive compounds existing\nin the spores are those they are also rich in fatty acids, in\nparticular long-chain C-19 fatty acids.",

In doing so, the RBC has to compromise\nwith both endogenous and exogenous sources of reactive\noxygen species (ROS) that damage and deteriorate its func-\ntion.

Because short life\nspan RBCs are constantly undergoing turnover and making\nthe blood system highly sensitive to environmentally very\npoisonous elements such as lead (Pb), the investigation on\nthe effect of Pb is of special significance in Bangladesh\nbecause of the fact that Pb poisoning has been one of\nthe major alarming public-health problems in Bangladesh\n[3]. RBC serves as the initial receptacle of absorbed Pb\nand distributes Pb throughout the body, making it available\nto other tissues.

G.\nlucidum is reportedly known to have anticancer, antitumor,\nantidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects [13–15]. Exposure\nto Pb can cause hypochromic microcytic anemia [16].

Conclusion\nRecently, the farming and commercialization of G. lucidum\nhave been started by different private entrepreneurs in\nBangladesh with the assistance of its agricultural extension\nprograms. Herbal remedies are relatively effective, cheap, and\nalmost devoid of side effects, compared to synthetic agents\n[45]. These findings thus point to the fact that complementary\nherbal therapies could be a good choice here in Bangladesh,\nwhere 26% of her 150-million population still live under\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n7\npoverty line [46] and iron deficiency affects its ∼50% of\nall children and ∼70% of all women [47]. Iron deficiency\nis the most common cause of anemia in Bangladesh [48]. Hence the attractive therapeutic strategies focusing on the\nmodulation of Pb-induced toxicity are warranted. Very likely\nwith arsenic toxicity, the lead toxicity has already posed\nsevere health problems in Bangladesh.",

    "content": "Very likely\nwith arsenic toxicity, the lead toxicity has already posed\nsevere health problems in Bangladesh. Anemia is one of\nthe most well-known toxic health effects associated with Pb\nexposure. Various mechanisms have been suggested for Pb-\nassociated anemia including interference with iron transport,\nshortening of erythrocyte life span, and inhibition of the\nglobulin synthesis and the impairment of heme metabolism\n[49, 50]. Our study clearly indicates that oral administration\nof G. lucidum extract significantly ameliorates the hemol-\nysis, with concurrent inhibitions of oxidative stress of the\nRBC membranes and liver tissues. Finally we suggest that\nconsumption of the G. lucidum could be used as one of the\nprophylactic means to reduce the body-burden of toxic Pb\nand Pb-toxicity-related early hemolysis and hence to combat\nanemia. Further studies are underway to understand the\nexact mechanism of action of G. lucidum on Pb-induced\ntoxicity.",

Extra‑oral infections caused by P. intermedia\nare mainly nasopharyngeal infection and intra‑abdominal\ninfection.[13] P. intermedia belonging to the orange complex\nof secondary colonizers is an important pathogen involved\nin the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and the organism\ncontributes for the disease progression along with other\norganisms. In our study, we tested the anti‑microbial\nactivity of an aqueous extract of the spores of G. lucidum\nagainst the clinical isolates of P. intermedia. Out of the 20\nclinical samples tested, 13 exhibited sensitivity at various\nconcentrations. Mean MIC value of the aqueous extract of\nthe powdered spores of G. lucidum for P. intermedia obtained\nwas 3.62 mcg/ml [Graph 1]. Activity of the aqueous extract\nof the spores of G. lucidum at 500 mcg/ml showed that\n65% of organisms were sensitive and 35% of organisms\nwere resistant [Graph 2].",

Previous\nstudies strongly suggest that ER stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several renal cell injury and\nkidney diseases, including renal tubular epithelial cell apoptosis32, podocyte injury in diabetic nephrop-\nathy33 and IR-induced AKI34. Excessive ER stress triggered by ischemia or H/R usually results in the\nup-regulation of the ER stress response protein GRP7835. GRP78 is an ER chaperone, a key unfolded\nprotein response (UPR) with multiple roles in protein processing and cellular protection and is a marker\nFigure 6.

Unlike\nother caspases, caspase-12 is specifically activated by insult-induced ER stress-dependent apoptosis40,41. Caspase-12 and p-JNK were up-regulated in the IR-exposed kidney18 and over-expressed in the diabetic\nkidney42. Activated JNK translocates to mitochondrial membrane, where it is decisive for cytochrome c\nrelease. Studies have shown that JNK is involved in ER stress-induced apoptosis in lung epithelial cells43\nand HeLa cells44. Additionally, the concomitant occurrence of both ER stress markers and JNK activation\nindicate that JNK activation occurs downstream of ER stress45 and that the ER stress-JNK pathway plays\nan important role in mediating insulin resistance and apoptosis46,47.",

    "content": "DISCUSSION\nWe present here a novel mouse model of spontaneous LTBI,\nwhich closely resembles human LTBI. The model was generated\nthrough experimental inoculation of M. tuberculosis without\nresorting to other means such as anti-tuberculosis drugs\ntreatment or Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin\nvaccination. A useful application of this model is to evaluate\nanti-tuberculosis drugs or vaccines during the early latency\nphase, which would be more eﬃcient than the previous models\n(Ziv et al., 2001; Ha et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2011). In\nthe present study, we demonstrated the eﬃciency of the new\nmouse LTBI model by testing the eﬀect of G. lucidum extract\non M.\ntuberculosis infection, by inhibiting M. tuberculosis\nreplication. To initiate the LTBI model, C57BL/6 mice were IV-injected\nwith 100 CFU M. tuberculosis inoculum. M.",

Tuberculosis\ninitially replicated in the lung and spleen, with bacterial\nloads rising until week 3, after which infection entered into\na latent phase with M.\ntuberculosis levels declining from\nweek 3 and stabilizing at a lower level till week 20. In\naccord with the bacterial load ﬁndings, pathological changes\nwere detected at week 3, which became prominent at week\n5, and then subsided to only mild perivascular inﬂammation\nfrom week 8 to 20. M.\ntuberculosis replication shifted\nfrom relatively active to dormant, resulting in lower bacterial\nloads and mild pathological changes in both the lung and\nspleen from weeks 8 to 20 post-inoculation. Thus, the period\nwithin 8 weeks would be regarded as “pre-latency phase,”\nand the period from week 8 to week 20 comprised the\nreal latency phase of M. tuberculosis infection in this model\n(Figures 2, 3).",

IBC lethality stems from its\nability to invade the vascular and lymphatic systems\nvia generation of tumor emboli that are responsible\nfor the inflammatory phenotype, and for metastases\n[2]. IBC tumors are categorized into subtypes based\non estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR)\npresence or absence, presence and extent of Human\nEpidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) ampli-\nfication, and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor\n(EGFR) overexpression. Importantly, IBC patients\nwith different molecular subtypes show different\noutcomes [3]. HER2 amplification accounts for ~40%\nof IBCs while EGFR overexpression occurs in ~30% of\nIBC cases and in ~50% of triple negative (TN)-IBCs\n[4].",

A pharmacological approach consisting of small\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has been developed\nto target EGFR and HER2. Erlotinib targets adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP)-binding sites, blocking the func-\ntion of EGFR-TK activity, while Lapatinib inhibits\nEGFR and HER2-TK activity. Both prevent the activa-\ntion of downstream cellular signals that promote tu-\nmor cell survival and proliferation and have been\nassessed as anti-IBC therapies [6]. Although promis-\ning, the high incidence of de novo or acquired TKI re-\nsistance has greatly diminished their overall effec-\ntiveness [7, 8]. Thus, studies are underway to identify\nagents that combined with TKIs provide a sustained\nresponse. Activation of downstream EGFR pathways,\nleads to persistent activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR\nand MAPK pathways and consequent development\nand maintenance of an EGFR resistant phenotype [9,\n10].",

Furthermore, the EGL treatment effec-\ntively induced the expression of Nrf2, as well as heme\noxygenase-1 (HO-1), with parallel phosphorylation\nand nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in the C2C12 myo-\nblasts.

Nrf2, a basic leucine zipper transcription factor ubiqui-\ntously expressed in most tissues, is a master cellular sensor\nof oxidative stress and represents the primary response to\nchanges in the cellular redox state [26, 27]. Under normal\nconditions, Nrf2 is bound to Kelch-like ECH-associated\nprotein 1 (Keap1) in the cytoplasm. Phase II enzyme in-\nducers can disrupt the Nrf2/Keap1 complex, resulting in\nthe release of Nrf2 and its subsequent translocation to the\nnucleus [28, 29]. In the nucleus, Nrf2 binds with and acti-\nvates the anti-oxidant response element (ARE), a cis-act-\ning enhancer present in the promoter region of a large\nand distinct set of target genes, with the aim of restoring\nredox homeostasis [27, 30].",

The final products of heme catabolism exert anti-\noxidant effects by neutralizing intracellular ROS [32, 33]. Moreover, enhanced HO-1 expression, which is mainly\nregulated by the Nrf2-ARE pathway, is associated with\nprotection against stress, such as oxidative stress [26, 34,\n35]. Recent studies reported that the stabilization or phos-\nphorylation of the Nrf2 protein increased the activation of\nthe Nrf2/HO-1 pathway. Several signaling molecules have\nbeen shown to participate in this process in response to a\nvariety of phase II gene inducers [36, 37]. Therefore, phar-\nmacological activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling is critical\nfor the protection of cells exposed to oxidative stress.",

Results\nTo evaluate the protective effect of EGL on H2O2-induced\ncytotoxicity, we treated the C2C12 cells with various con-\ncentrations of EGL for 24 hours, and the optimal dose (i.e.,\nthe dose that had the least effect on cell viability) was se-\nlected by determining the percentage of MTT reduction. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of the cell cultures with 5 ─\n50 μg/mL of EGL for 24 hours had no effect on the cell vi-\nability. However, 100 μg/mL EGL induced a partial reduc-\ntion in the cell viability. Thus, 50 μg/mL of EGL was chosen\nas the highest optimal dose for studying the cytoprotective\neffect of EGL against H2O2-induced cell damage.

Discussion\nAlthough few studies have investigated how oxidative\nstress quantitatively affects the load-carrying capacity of\nmuscle cells [6, 7], oxidative stress is known to accompany\nmuscle dysfunction [3, 7]. Oxidative stress occurs when the\nproduction of ROS exceeds their catabolism. ROS belong\nto a class of endogenous signaling molecules, the func-\ntions of which depend on their subcellular localization,\nlocal concentration, and duration of production. Moder-\nate levels of ROS transiently oxidize cysteine sulphydryl,\nwhich contributes to the active sites of most proteins [4,\n5]. However, when the accumulation of ROS exceeds a cer-\ntain threshold, ROS have adverse effects on cellular func-\ntions [1, 4], leading to cellular dysfunction and cell death in\nskeletal muscles [6, 7]. The mitochondrial electron trans-\nport system is a major source of intracellular ROS genera-\ntion [3-5], with mitochondria playing a pivotal role in the\nROS-mediated cell-death process.",

    "content": "Therefore, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling may represent a\npotential therapeutic target in the management of oxida-\ntive stress-related diseases. Studies have proposed that\nthe induction of phosphorylation plays a key role in the\nregulation of the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 [36, 37]. A number of protein kinases have been implicated in the\nregulation of Nrf2 activity, with upstream signals facilitat-\ning the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus, whereupon\nit binds to ARE in promoter regions [2-30]. In the present\nstudy, we found that EGL increased the expression of the\nNrf2 protein in C2C12 myoblasts in a concentration- and\nduration-dependent manner. Subsequently, we found that\nEGL triggered the induction of HO-1 expression and led\nto Nrf2 phosphorylation, along with concomitant trans-\nlocation of Nrf2 into the nuclei.",

However, ZnPP-induced\ninhibition of the expression of HO-1 significantly weak-\nened the inhibitory effects of EGL on H2O2-induced inhi-\nbition of cell growth by blocking the generation of ROS. In\naddition, the knockdown of Nrf2 by Nrf2-targeted siRNA\ncompletely abrogated EGL-induced HO-1 expression. This\nfinding suggests that Nrf2 is a critical upstream regulator\nof EGL-mediated induction of HO-1 in C2C12 myoblasts. Furthermore, the knockdown of Nrf2 halted the ability of\nEGL to restore the growth of C2C12 cells inhibited by H2O2. These results suggest that the Nrf2-dependent induction of\nHO-1 by EGL may participate, at least partly, in the protec-\ntion against oxidative stress in C2C12 myoblasts.",

Oxidative stress mainly contributes to the vul­\nnerability of DAergic cells, mitochondrial dys­\nfunction and chronic neuroinflammation in the\nprocess of PD [39].

Unfortunately, this transition\nleads to numerous health problems and obesity-related disorders, such as the development of\ncardiovascular diseases (CVD), one of the major causes of death worldwide [1]. Epidemiologi-\ncal studies have shown that elevated total plasma cholesterol levels cause hyperlipidemia and\nincreased risk of CVD [2]. In the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program\n(NCEP), the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines proposed to reduce plasma choles-\nterol concentrations, including lower intakes of dietary cholesterol (<200 mg/day) and satu-\nrated fat (<7% of calories), as well as an increase in viscous soluble fiber (10–25 g/day) [3].",

Cholesterol homeostasis in the body is mainly controlled by the endogenous synthesis,\nintestinal absorption, and hepatic excretion of dietary cholesterol. These processes are medi-\nated by several transcription factors, which are fundamental to understanding the regulation of\ncholesterol metabolism. Sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (Srebp2) is the key regula-\ntor of gene expression linked to cholesterol synthesis, including the rate-limiting enzyme\n3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr).

The two rate-limiting reac-\ntions of melanin biosynthesis are initially catalyzed by tyrosinase: the hydroxylation of L-tyrosinase to\n3, 4-dihydroxyphenylanlanine (L-DOPA) and the subsequent oxidation of L-DOPA to dopaquinone. Furthermore, dopaquinone is a highly reactive ortho-quinone, which forms melanin by spontaneous polymeri-\nzation7. Further, melanin was transferred to keratinocytes by melanocytes, and each epidermal melanocyte inter-\nacts with approximately 36 keratinocytes during melanosome transfer8. Interestingly, the number of tyrosinase\nmolecules present in black or white skin color is equal; therefore, the level of tyrosinase activity in melanocytes\nwill regulate cutaneous pigmentation9.",

E3 ubiquitin ligase Smurf2 (Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2) participates in modulating\nTGFβ​-mediated signaling by targeting the ubiquitination of TGFR16. Unlike growth factor receptors that directly\nrecruit E3 ligases, TGFRI requires an adaptor protein, Smad7, to recruit its E3 ligase17. In addition, Smad7 sta-\nbilizes the Smurf2-TGFRI complex and help E3 ligase-Smurf2 to ubiquitylate TGFRI. Furthermore, the traffick-\ning of TGFRs is intimately linked to the control of the activity and termination of signaling events.

Moreover, the level of Smad4, which is a transcription factor for TGFβ​/TGFR signaling also decreased upon FFLZ\ntreatment (Fig. 3D).

Therefore, we proposed that the TLR4/Tollip axis may involve fucose-containing\npolysaccharides-induced UPP in the down-regulation of TGFR expression and related signaling pathways in the\nbreast cancer cells, leading to decreased cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.",

    "content": "In general, the lipid rafts/caveolae-mediated and non-lipid rafts/clathrin-mediated pathways participate in\nthe regulation of TGFR functions43. We previously reported that polysaccharides can reduce lung cancer tumor-\nigenesis2, and fucose-rich polysaccharides extracted from brown seaweeds (fucoidan) potentially suppress breast\ncancer metastasis44. Here, we first found that FFLZ enhances the translocation of TGFRI to the lipid rafts/caveolae\nfraction via sucrose gradient centrifugation. Specifically, we demonstrated that FFLZ increases the inhibition\nof TGFβ​ signaling via promoting TGFR trafficking to the caveolin-1-rich lipid-raft fraction. Interestingly, both\nstructure of FFLZ and fucoidan contain fucose residues in side chains or backbone of polysaccharide. Therefore,\nthese data implied that polysaccharides containing fucose residues may modulate the degradation and translo-\ncation of TGFRs.",

Furthermore, our results indicated that FFLZ disrupts the balance of lipid-raft fractions and\npromotes the localization of the TGFRs to the caveolae, which facilitates UPP-mediated TGFR degradation. In addition, it has been shown that the clathrin-coated early endosome promotes TGFβ​-induced Smad and\nnon-Smad (e.g., phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT pathways) activation and transcriptional responses43. Metastatic breast cancer cells also tend to enter the clathrin-mediated (EEA-1-conjugated) early endosome to\nmodulate the TGFR signaling pathways45.

Ganoderma lucidum is a revered medicinal mushroom for health-promoting beneﬁts in the Orient. Here, we found that oral administra-\ntion of the polysaccharides and water extract from G. lucidum promoted neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation to enhance neuro-\ngenesis and alleviated cognitive deﬁcits in transgenic AD mice. G. lucidum polysaccharides (GLP) also promoted self-renewal of NPC\nin cell culture. Further mechanistic study revealed that GLP potentiated activation of ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and\ndownstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and AKT cascades. Consistently, inhibition of FGFR1 effectively blocked the\nGLP-promoted NPC proliferation and activation of the downstream cascades.",

GLP Potentiate FGFR1 Activation to Promote NPC\nProliferation\nRecent reports have shown that membrane receptors such\nas TLR4, CR3, and FGFR1 mediate the effects of polysaccha-\nrides (Chen et al., 2009; Makani et al., 2016). Therefore, we\nhypothesized that membrane proteins associated with\nNPC proliferation might act as a potential target for GLP. FGFR1 and EGF receptor (EGFR) are receptors for bFGF\nand EGF, two critical growth factors for NPC proliferation\nand self-renewal in the hippocampus (Kuhn et al., 1997). Thus, we monitored the activity of these receptors in the\nNPC cultured in the reduced-growth-factor medium on\nimmunoblots. As shown in Figure 5A, following GLP\ntreatment FGFR1 phosphorylation increased, peaked at\n1–2 min, then declined slowly. GLP treatment increased\nFGFR1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner\n(Figure 5B).",

It is commonly\nreferred to as “lingzhi” in China, India and Japan, and it has been used in most Asian countries for the\npromotion of health and longevity for centuries [1,2]. Numerous pharmacological effects associated\nwith lingzhi have been recorded, among which are immunomodulatory [3], anti-inﬂammatory [4],\nantiviral [5], antioxidative, antiaging and antitumor [6] properties. Several studies have shown that\nGanoderma lucidum contains a wide range of bioactive compounds associated with the promotion of\ngood health [1,2].",

For all these reasons, Ganoderma lucidum is considered an interesting fungus, widely\nused in alternative medicine and proven to have numerous implications for use as a potential anticancer\ndrug; however, further research needs to be done to quantify it for personalized medicine, especially\nin treating speciﬁc tumor diseases such as prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) and other cancers [7]. The\nbiological activities reported from preparations from Ganoderma lucidum are remarkable and are given\nthe most emphasis herein as distinct from the structure/activity information. The metabolites consist\nof mainly polysaccharides and terpenoids, especially phenolic compounds Many of these biological\ncompounds work against the major diseases of our time, and hence the present research is of great\nimportance.",

Discussion\nGanoderma lucidum is a mushroom rich with bioactive compounds, among which are fatty\nacids, nucleosides, amino acids, proteins, peptides, alkaloids, steroids, enzymes, triterpenoids and\npolysaccharides. Among all of these, triterpenoids and polysaccharides represent the main constituents\ncontributing to its anticancer functions [14,15]. Many Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides (GLPS)\nexert immune-modulating functions through activating the expression of cytokines associated with\ninﬂammatory response (such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α) or anti-tumor\nactivity (such as interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α) [16]. Even if some authors indicate a\ndirect cytotoxicity of GLPS on cancer cells [17], the anticancer functions of GLPS are, however, still\ngenerally believed to be closely associated with their immune-stimulating effects [1]. Growing clinical\nevidence suggests the important role of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines during tumor development.",

Speciﬁcally, many cytokines were reported to act as pro-inﬂammatory factors both in melanoma and\ntriple-negative breast cancer: as an example, recent studies have shown that several cytokines are\nproduced by cancer cells, or by the tumor microenvironment, in order to increase their progression and\nsurvival. Speciﬁcally, the association between interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the pathogenesis of melanoma\nand breast cancer was studied [18,19]. Increased IL-6 expression has been related to an advanced\ndisease stage and decreased survival in breast and melanoma cancer patients [20,21]. The release\nof IL-6 is biologically related to an induction of tumor cell proliferation and inhibition of cellular\napoptosis through the involvement of Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducer and activator of\ntranscription 3 (STAT3).",

In addition,\nno statistically significant differences were found in the\nconcentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, or Cd in the rat teeth.30\nHowever, the concentrations of Zn, Ag, and B decreased and\nthe concentrations of Fe and Sr increased.30 In our study, an\nincrease was detected in the concentration of B in rat teeth\nexposed to ELF-EMF for 26 days (Group I).",

Increases\nand decreases in TE concentrations can have toxic effects\non human health. There were changes in the values of car­\niogenic elements such as Se, Mg, Cd, and Pb. ELF-EMFs\nincreased the values of Se, Cd, Pb, and Mn. The use of anti­\noxidants, especially MLT, was found to reduce these values\nto their normal levels. However, we believe that further\nepidemiological, histological, and chemical studies should\nbe conducted in this area.",

    "content": "Discussion\nBrain is particularly vulnerable organ to oxidative stress\ndue to high oxygen consumption, abundant polyunsaturat­\ned fatty acids and low endogenous antioxidant levels. Free\nradicals may attack proteins of plasma membrane and oth­\ner proteins in cellular membranes, thus disrupting organelle\nfunctionality. Therefore, it may be useful treatment for isch­\nemic incidents to induce antioxidative effect. Superoxide\ndismutase is primary protective molecule against tissue dam­\naged caused by reactive oxygen species. It catalyzes su­\nperoxide anion into hydrogen peroxide and prevents for­\nmation of hydroxyl radicals. It has been shown superoxide\ndismutase activity decreased in serum of stroke patients. Increasing anti oxidative activity may be beneficial in treat­\nment of acute cerebral ischemia. In present study, we ob­\nserved superoxide dismutase activity decreased after trau­\nma-caused cerebral injury while its activity got close to usual\nlevel after post-traumatic G. lucidum treatment.",

Recently, this mushroom has come under scientific scrutiny to examine the possibility of finding\nbiologically active compounds that may have an impact on human physiology. The main category\nof biologically active compounds produced in the G. lucidum, are the triterpenoids, which are\nknown as Ganoderic Acids. In this review, we discuss one Ganoderic Acid in particular known as\nGanoderic Acid-DM (GA-DM) that is extracted from the Ganoderma lucidum mushroom. We will\ndiscuss GA-DM as a potential therapeutic candidate for treating a number of diseases yet will\nfocus on the potential to be used as an alternative or supplemental therapeutic agent in regards to\nvarious cancer types.",

Numerous mushrooms are cultivated and used as herbal medicine despite any\nempirical evidence for benefit except for anecdotal evidence or conclusions drawn from\nanimal models experiments [5-7]. One of the more popular medicinal mushrooms is\nGanoderma lucidum which comes from the shiny appearance of its fruiting body [1,8]. The\nmore common names of Ganoderma lucidum however, come from its purported health\nbenefits rather than its physical appearance. In China and Korea, the Ganoderma lucidum is\nknown as the lingzhi and is regarded as the “herb of spiritual potency” [6]. In Japan,\nGanoderma lucidum is called reishi or mannentake and is regarded as the ten thousand year\nmushroom [1].",

This medical practice of consuming Ganoderma lucidum\ncaused this mushroom to have a widespread effect on the culture so as to appear in\nnumerous pieces of artwork and literature beginning in the Yuan Dynasty (1280-1368 A.D.)\n[1,5]. The consumption of Ganoderma lucidum by Far East countries for medical purposes\ntakes on different methods of ingesting the mushroom.

In herbal medicine practices in the Far East,\nGanoderma lucidum is prescribed in different ways [1,5]. The methods range from injecting\na solution of powdered spores to drinking a soup, syrup, tea, capsule, tincture, or bolus with\nthe mushroom powder in the concoction [1].

These studies suggest that through systemic\nadministration of GA-DM, a therapeutic effect can be observed when the concentration of\nGA-DM is around 20 μM [4], yet is in the nM range when using the nanoparticle route\n(unpublished data).",

Diseases Involved in GA-DM Research\nProstate cancer\nProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men, and is the second most\ncommon cause of cancer-related deaths in the western world [16,37,38]. There is a growing\ninterest in developing more effective treatments options due to the frequency and mortality\nassociated with prostate cancer. Currently, when a patient is diagnosed with prostate cancer,\nthe most common treatment options include prostatectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy\n[16,24,39].

It has been shown that GA-DM treatment inhibits both the activity of 5-α-\nreductase and the conversion of testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). 5-α-reductase is\ncrucial to androgen development as it reduces testosterone to its active form,\ndihydrotestosterone (DHT) [16,41]. The inhibition of DHT activity possibly occurs due to\nthe conformational similarity in the structures of DHT and GA-DM. GA-DM competitively\nblocks the androgen receptors, preventing DHT binding and obstructing the normal DHT-\nmediated signaling pathway which results in cell survival.

Introduction\nAlzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenera-\ntive disease among elderly population.[1–3] It often manifests with\nlosing\nof\nreasoning,\nmemory,\nlanguage,\nand\npersonality\nchanges.[4,5] It has been reported that AD accounts for 60%\nto 70% of all dementia cases.[6] It has been estimated that the\nworldwide prevalence increases from 26.6 million in 2006 to the\nquadruple numbers with 1 in 85 persons worldwide by 2050.[7]\nThe health care costs $172 billion per year for patients with AD in\nthe United States alone.[8] Thus, it brings a severer public health\nchallenge for the society, especially with the rapid increase of the\naging population worldwide. Treatment mainly consists of cognition enhancing medica-\ntions. These medications include donepezil,[9–11] galantamine,[12–\n13] memantine,[14–16] and rivastigmine.[17,18] However, all these\nmedications can not cure AD completely.",

In Figure 5, we found that the\nGL-PS treated DCs expressed relatively higher levels of\nMHC-II, CD40, CD80, and CD86 when compared with\nuntreated DCs. We then measured IL-10, IL-12p70 by ELISA of super-\nnatants from cultured Mo-DCs isolated from the different\ntreatment groups. As shown in Figure 6, Mo-DCs of the\ncontrol group showed little secretion of IL-10 and IL-12p70,\nwhile GL-PS groups produced a significant increase in the\nsecretion of IL-10 and IL-12p70. The purity of each population used in the current study\nwas conﬁrmed by multicolor ﬂow cytometry where more\nthan 85% of the Mo-DC populations bound to the CD103\nmAb (data not shown).\n678\nIntegrative Cancer Therapies 17(3)",

Over the\npast decade, beekeepers have experienced a dramatic increase in annual colony losses, typically averaging well\nover 30%2–4. This combination of high demand and reduced supply has led to expansive increases in pollination\ncosts for growers, while beekeepers have been hard-pressed to maintain adequate numbers of healthy honey bee\ncolonies to remain economically viable, even with the benefit of higher pollination service fees.

DWV is a devastating virus that causes shriveled wings,\nreduced worker life span, reduced foraging, and immunosuppression in honey bees14,15 (Fig. 1A).

Currently, beekeepers are only able to indirectly control virus levels by using miticides to reduce mite infes-\ntation rates in managed honey bees. Overall, this effort has worked with only limited success, given the rapidity\nwith which Varroa mites have developed resistance to synthetic miticides20,21. Another potential approach would\nbe to reduce virus levels directly in honey bees by using a functional antiviral material, but no such products are\ncurrently available.

One of the main clinical challenges is that PCa progresses from androgen-responsive to\nandrogen-refractory/castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is incurable. Androgen\nreceptor (AR), a master androgenic hormone-activated transcription factor, plays a key role in the\nregulation of PCa growth, survival, and deadly CRPC progression [1,2]. Androgen deprivation therapy\n(ADT), blocking the androgen/AR signaling pathway, is a ﬁrst-line therapy in clinical intervention\nin PCa patients. However, most PCa patients who receive ADT suffer severe adverse effects and\neventually relapse with lethal CRPC progression. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel\nand effective treatments to prevent and cure this fatal aggressiveness.

Speciﬁcally, SREBP-1 transcriptionally\nactivates genes that are involved in lipogenesis, such as fatty acid synthase (FASN; a rate-limiting\nenzyme and a check point for lipogenesis), whereas SREBP-2 mediates cholesterol biosynthesis\nthrough the regulation of HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR; a rate-limiting enzyme and a check point\nfor cholesterogenesis) [3,5,6].

GTEE Inhibits the Expression of SREBP-1 and Its Downstream Associated Genes in PCa Cells\nTo investigate whether GTEE inhibits SREBP-1/lipogenesis and the AR axis in PCa cells, which\nplay important roles in PCa development, survival, and progression [7,8,16,17], we performed\nquantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot analyses\nto determine the expression of genes that are associated with SREBPs and AR. As shown in Figure 1A,\nGTEE decreased the mRNA expression of SREBP-1 and FASN in both LNCaP and C4-2 cells. However,\nGTEE did not signiﬁcantly change the expression of SREBP-2 and HMGCR in PCa cells, which mainly\ncontrolled cholesterogenesis. We also examined whether GTEE affected AR and PSA expression in\nthese AR-positive PCa cells, because we previously reported that SREBP-1 transcriptionally regulated\nAR expression [7,8].",

Discussion\nActivation of lipogenesis in cancer cells has been shown to be triggered by increased needs for the\ncomponents of cell lipid bilayer membranes, and promotion of the signaling transduction mediated by cell\nmembranes during uncontrolled cell division, growth, and tumor aggressiveness [18–20]. Overexpression\nof a master transcription regulator for lipogenesis, SREBP-1, was associated with aggressive pathologic\nfeatures, including CRPC progression, and poor clinical outcomes in human PCa [7]. Therefore, targeting\naberrant de novo fatty acid/lipid biosynthesis linked to SREBP-1 represents a new and attractive\ntherapeutic strategy to treat PCa malignancy. In this study, we first discovered that GTEE would\nbe able to suppress the genotypes (Figure 1) and phenotypes (Figure 2) of lipogenesis in both LNCaP\n(androgen-responsive) and C4-2 (castration-resistant) cells.",

Consistent with our previous ﬁndings [7], SREBP-1\nwas associated with oxidative stress and ROS production in PCa cells. Although we demonstrated\nthat GTEE interrupted the SREBP-1-regulated metabolic pathway and suppressed PCa cell growth\nand progression in the present study, the molecular mechanism by which GTEE inhibits SREBP-1\nexpression in PCa cells remains unclear. In order to determine the molecular basis, an additional\nexperiment was performed using a promoter-luciferase reporter vector of SREBP-1. As shown in\nFigure S2, GTEE signiﬁcantly decreased the promoter-luciferase activity of SREBP-1 in LNCaP and\nC4-2 cells. Based on the results of qPCR, Western blotting (Figure 1) and the promoter reporter assays,\nGTEE blocking SREBP-1 in PCa cells is mediated through transcriptional regulation.",

AR is referred to as one of the most signiﬁcant protein factors for PCa, even in lethal CRPC\naggressiveness, and it is still the primary focus of new drug design. Up-regulation of AR expression and\nactivity has been well deﬁned to promote PCa development, survival, and CRPC progression [1,2,27]. The therapeutic strategies of PCa treatment have been developed to target AR via a blockade of AR\nnuclear translocation [27,28], silencing of AR gene expression [8,29,30], including the full length or\nsplice variants of AR, or interruption of the interaction between AR and its co-factors, as well as their\ndownstream functions [27,28,31].

The molecular basis of AR expression\ninhibited by GTEE could be due to down-regulation of SREBP-1, because we previously demonstrated\nthat SREBP-1 transcriptionally activated AR expression through binding of a SREBP-1 cis-acting\nelement located in the 5′ ﬂanking AR promoter region [8]. Besides, GTEE also reduced PSA expression\nin LNCaP and C4-2 cells. PSA is one of the downstream target genes of AR and it has been well used\nto diagnose PCa disease [32,33] as a clinically important serum biomarker for PCa. Taken together,\nthrough the inhibition of SREBP-1, GTEE impaired AR and PSA expression in PCa cells. This could be\nexploited for a better therapeutic application by co-targeting aberrant lipogenesis and the AR/PSA\nsignaling pathway using GTEE in PCa. GTEE also displayed the induction of apoptosis in PCa cells.",

These techniques are all based on mycelia\ngrowth and submerged culture of G. lingzhi. However, about\n80–85% of commercial Lingzhi products including fruiting body\nslices, wall-breaking spore, tablets, syrups, and oral liquid are\nderived from the fruiting body (Zhou et al., 2012).

From this study, high oxygen\nwas beneﬁcial to enhance the contents of phenolic compound\nand ganoderic acid. The optimal operation was treating\nG. lingzhi fruiting body with 60% oxygen for 3 days, and\nthe transcriptional levels of ganoderic acid synthesis-related\nenzymes were induced under this condition. The free radical\nscavenging with DPPH·, ABTS·, OH·, and O2−· and DNA\ndamage protective activity were also increased at diﬀerent degrees\nby 60% oxygen. Based on these results, it is possible to employ\na high oxygen concentration to induce the bioactive compound\nsynthesis, resulting in enhanced bioactivity and quality of\nG. lingzhi fruiting body.",

The study\naimed to determine the hepatoprotective effect of crude polysaccharides extracted from Ganoderma lucidum against liver\ninjury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Materials and Methods: Twenty-four male BALB/C mice were randomly divided into six groups. Serum and liver\nsamples were taken on day 10 after G. lucidum administration. The levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate\naminotransferase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) were measured using\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and the histology of the liver was evaluated using light microscopy.",

Given that, the incidence of jaundice\nand hepatitis has increased the development of hepa­\ntoprotective drugs from natural sources which is nec­\nessary. Liver damage may arise from excessive alcohol\nintake or exposure to toxins and environmental pollut­\nants and can progress into severe liver diseases such\nas hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer [1,2]. Reactive\noxygen species (ROS) cause cellular damage in the\nliver [3], and increased ROS can be caused by expo­\nsure to toxic substances such as carbon tetrachloride\n(CCl4) [4].

    "content": "Cell protection against\nfree radical attacks is dependent on radical scavengers\nsuch as SOD and CAT. SOD converts superoxide rad­\nicals to H2O2, and this is then metabolized by CAT\ninto H2O and O2, ultimately preventing liver cell dam­\nage caused by these free radicals [30]. SOD and CAT\nlevels increased in the mice administered G. lucidum,\ndemonstrating that G. lucidum extract can restore and\nmaintain the activity of SOD and CAT. The previous\nstudies have suggested that CCl4 reduces the activity of\nantioxidant enzymes and causes hepatopathy [31,32]. The administration of G. lucidum can thus protect\nagainst free radicals, protecting hepatocytes from\nhepatopathy.",

    "content": "Conclusion\nIn this study, G. lucidum administration\ndecreased the levels of ALT, AST, and MDA and\nincreased the levels of SOD and CAT in CCl4-treated\nmice. This indicates that G. lucidum has significant\nhepatoprotective activity, which likely results from its\nantioxidant activity. Ultimately, G. lucidum could be\ndeveloped as a novel protective agent against acute\nliver damage.

It is characterized by uncontrolled\ncell growth in lung tissue, which may cause metastasis, invasion\nof adjacent tissues, and infiltration outside the lungs. Lung can-\ncer is divided into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Lecharpentier et al. 2011; Aberle et al.\n2011; Wen et al. 2017). It is the most frequent cancer among all\nmalignant tumours worldwide, causing cancer-related deaths of\n1.6 million individuals every year (Liu et al. 2017). In addition,\nlung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related deaths among\nmen and second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths among\nwomen worldwide. In recent years, research on treatments of\nlung cancer have led to many advances in surgery, chemother-\napy, and radiotherapy (Wang et al. 2018).

IBC accounts for 1-5% of breast cancers,\nwhere younger women are more likely to have\nmetastatic disease at diagnosis and tend to\ndisplay shorter survival [1]. The prognosis for\nIBC is bleak, with a median overall survival rate\nbetween 2.27 to 3.40 years in patients diag­\nnosed with IBC stage III or IV, respectively [2]. Management of IBC is challenging because of\na lack of specific therapies, aggressive tumor\nbehavior, and a high recurrence rate. IBC is\ngenerally treated using a multimodal approach\ncomprising preoperative systemic chemothera­\npy, HER-2 targeted therapy, modified radical\nmastectomy, and radiation [3].

Carboplatin is\none of the leading platinum-based anti-cancer\ndrugs used because of its efficacy and low tox­\nicity. However, tumors can become resistant to\nthese agents by the activation of DNA Damage\nResponse (DDR) program [5, 6]. Furthermore,\nrecent investigations have identified the contri­\nbution of cancer stem cells to platinum-based\ndrug chemoresistance in cancer [6-8]. Thus,\nstudies are underway to identify low toxicity\nagents combined with carboplatin to improve\ncancer patients’ clinical response. Two central kinases mediate DDR: Rad3-relat-\ned protein (ATR) and Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mu-\ntated (ATM).
