    "content": "INTRODUCTION\n\nCandida-associated denture stomatitis (DS) is the most common form of oral candidiasis [1]. It is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the mucosa under removable dentures, particularly complete maxillary dentures, with a prevalence rate of 11%-67%. This inflammatory condition can cause symptoms such as erythema, swelling of the mucous membranes, and occasional pain and burning sensation [1-3]. DS is a multifactorial disease, and poor denture hygiene and its suboptimal adaptation, diabetes mellitus, smoking, allergies, nutrition, and multiple microorganisms have been suggested as its common etiologies. However, Candida Antifungal Effects of Ganoderma and Clotrimazole Volume 21 | Article 45 | Dec 2024                                                                                                                                    2 / 9 albicans (C. albicans) remains the principal etiological agent for DS [3].",

However, only a few have been isolated from humans, and C. albicans remains the most common cause of fungal disease in humans due to its high pathogenicity [5]. One of the most commonly used classifications of DS was presented by Av [6] and Ostlund [7], which includes three types: Type I is DS with hyperemic foci, type II is DS with diffuse hyperemia, and type III is DS with granular inflammation. DS is generally followed by erythema, swelling of the oral mucosa, and occasional pain or burning sensation [8]. Elimination of predisposing factors is the first strategy in treatment of oral candidiasis, and various topical and systemic agents are currently available for this purpose [9]. Topical agents such as nystatin, amphotericin B, miconazole, and clotrimazole are recommended as the first-line treatment [9].",

Clotrimazole is well tolerated by patients and has insignificant complications. However, drug resistance is quite common in immunocompromised patients [10]. Also, a recent investigation elaborated on some adverse effects of clotrimazole such as burning sensation and occasional skin irritation [11]. In addition, it has been discovered that other microbial agents, including Streptococcus and Lactobacillus species, may accompany C. albicans. Ganoderma lucidum (G. lucidum), also known as lingzhi, is one of the most valuable and well- known fungi, which is predominantly used in Asia for various medicinal purposes, and has more than 300 species [12]. Furthermore, it is classified as a “superior herb” that can be used continuously without any complications [13].",

Triterpenoids have anti-inflammatory, anti-hypertensive, anti- cholesterol, anti-liver fibrosis, antitumor, anti- aging, and immunomodulatory effects.

The association of age, sex, history of denture use, denture cleaning, sleeping with denture, smoking, and Av [6] and Ostlund [7] classification with the recovery of DS was also investigated. The results indicated that only the Av [6] and Ostlund [7] classification and sleeping with denture had a significant association with DS recovery. In other words, the percentage of complete recovery was significantly higher in patients with DS type I and patients that removed their denture overnight (before entering the study). In fact, it can be stated that removing denture overnight can be effective for relaxing the jaw and mouth and prevent the occurrence of DS or decrease its intensity as much as possible.
